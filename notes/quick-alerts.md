You can use webhooks to intercept the event data. An easy way of testing this is configuring an alert with a test webhook at:

http://webhook.site

## Use-cases
- Notifying admins when fees are paid so that they can collect.
- Analytics for contract activity, especially while promoting a dapp.
- Watching prices and executing trades via transaction call triggered by webhook.


## Good to know
You can subscribe to topics, which are hashes of the function signature of an event. You can check for the signature here:
